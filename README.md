# 📊 Telecommunications Customer Churn Analysis (Tableau Dashboard)

## 🎯 Project Overview & Objectives
This project provides an in-depth analysis of telecommunications customer churn. The primary goal is to identify the specific factors driving customer churn and propose data-backed strategies to increase customer retention. A central theme explored throughout the dashboard is whether aggressive promotion of streaming and add-on services, especially to new or monthly-contract customers, may be inadvertently increasing churn. The analysis reveals a key insight: higher short-term revenue may be coming at the cost of long-term customer relationships, as churned customers consistently have higher monthly charges and shorter contract durations.

  - Two-Year: retention is **590% higher**

### 🔹 Streaming Services & Add-Ons

- Churned customers consistently pay more for each service.
- Retention rates can be compared against overall benchmarks shown at the bottom of each dashboard.

### 🔹 Demographics Dashboard

- Segmented by demographic categories to highlight churn-prone groups.
- Categories with **low retention–churn rate differences** may signal higher churn risk.

### 🔹 FCC Complaints Rate Dashboard

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

Based on the findings:

1. **Avoid marketing streaming services and add-ons to monthly customers**, as this combination correlates strongly with higher churn.
2. **Incentivize transitions to longer-term contracts**:
   - Offer free trials of add-ons for customers who upgrade.
   - Example:  
     - 3 months free for switching to a one-year contract  
     - 6 months free for switching to a two-year contract
