# 📊 Telecommunications Customer Churn Analysis (Tableau Dashboard)

## 📁 Data Sources

This dashboard integrates two datasets:

- **Telecommunications Customer Churn Dataset**  
  In-house customer data including demographics, subscription services, usage, and churn status.

- **FCC Consumer Complaints Dataset**  
  Publicly available data compiled by the FCC, detailing consumer complaints by category and geography.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

This analysis aims to answer two key questions:

1. What specific areas are contributing to customer churn?
2. Where will targeted efforts have the greatest impact in reducing churn?

A central theme explored throughout the dashboard is whether aggressive promotion of streaming and add-on services — especially to new or monthly-contract customers — may be inadvertently increasing churn. The data suggests that short-term revenue gains may be coming at the expense of long-term customer relationships.

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

Based on the findings:

1. **Avoid marketing streaming services and add-ons to monthly customers**, as this combination correlates strongly with higher churn.
2. **Incentivize transitions to longer-term contracts**:
   - Offer free trials of add-ons for customers who upgrade.
   - Example:  
     - 3 months free for switching to a one-year contract  
     - 6 months free for switching to a two-year contract
